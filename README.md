# prot DietGPU to HipANS 

## Introduction

This warehouse contains the process of migrating DietGPU projects from using NVIDIA CUDA technology to using AMD HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) technology. The purpose of  migration is to expand DietGPU hardware compatibility so that it can run on AMD GPU, while maintaining or improving existing performance as much as possible.
